# Pokedex Architecture

## Overview

This Pokedex application follows modern React best practices with proper separation of concerns, custom hooks, and service layers.

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. **Service Layer** (`src/services/`)

- **`api.js`**: Centralized API service for all server communication
- Uses axios with base configuration
- Handles errors and timeouts consistently
- Separates API logic from UI components

### 2. **Custom Hooks** (`src/hooks/`)

- **`usePokemon.js`**: Manages Pokemon data fetching, images, and cries
- **`usePokemonFilters.js`**: Handles all filtering logic and state
- **`usePokemonRegistration.js`**: Manages registration form state and validation
- Each hook has a single responsibility and is reusable

### 3. **UI Components** (`src/components/`)

- **Reusable UI Components**: `Button`, `Card`, `SectionHeader`, `FormLabel`, `CheckboxList`
- **Feature Components**: `Header`, `Sort`, `Register`, `Entries`
- Components are focused on presentation, not business logic

### 4. **Constants** (`src/constants/`)

- **`pokemon.js`**: All Pokemon-related constants (types, generations, etc.)
- Centralized data that can be imported anywhere

### 5. **Utilities** (`src/utils/`)

- **`pokemon.js`**: Helper functions for Pokemon data manipulation
- Pure functions that can be easily tested

## Benefits of This Architecture

### ✅ **Separation of Concerns**

- API calls are isolated in services
- Business logic is in custom hooks
- UI components only handle presentation
- Constants are centralized

### ✅ **Reusability**

- Custom hooks can be used in multiple components
- UI components are modular and reusable
- Service functions can be called from anywhere

### ✅ **Testability**

- Each layer can be tested independently
- Custom hooks can be tested with React Testing Library
- Service functions are pure and easy to test
- UI components can be tested in isolation

### ✅ **Maintainability**

- Clear file organization
- Single responsibility principle
- Easy to find and modify specific functionality
- Reduced coupling between components

### ✅ **Performance**

- Custom hooks use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for optimization
- Filtering logic is memoized
- API calls are debounced and cached

## State Management

- **Local State**: Managed by custom hooks
- **No Global State**: Uses prop drilling (appropriate for this app size)
- **Future**: Could easily add Context or Redux if needed

## Error Handling

- API errors are caught and handled gracefully
- Loading states are managed
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback data when server is unavailable

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate complex state logic
2. **Service Layer**: Separate API concerns
3. **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components
4. **Type Safety**: Consistent data structures
5. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
6. **Performance**: Memoization and optimization
7. **Testing**: Easily testable architecture
